Available online 19 August 2011 The discussion about women's access to and use of digital Information and Communication
Technology (ICT) in developing countries has been inconclusive so far. Some claim that women
are rather technophobic and that men are much better users of digital tools, while others argue
that women enthusiastically embrace digital communication. This article puts this question to
an empirical test. We analyze data sets from 12 Latin American and 13 African countries from
2005 to 2008. This is believed to be the most extensive empirical study in this field so far. The
results are surprisingly consistent and revealing: the reason why fewer women access and use
ICT is a direct result of their unfavorable conditions with respect to employment, education and
income. When controlling for these variables, women turn out to be more active users of digital
tools than men. This turns the alleged digital gender divide into an opportunity: given women's
affinity for ICT, and given that digital technologies are tools that can improve living conditions,
ICT represents a concrete and tangible opportunity to tackle longstanding challenges of gender
inequalities in developing countries, including access to employment, income, education and
health services.

Introduction
During the second half of the last century, human kind has
turned to the “massive task of making our bewildering store
of knowledge more accessible” (Bush, 1945). The result has
brought on irrevocable social, productive, political and
cultural transformations, which are based on a global communication
infrastructure that includes innovations like the
Internet, mobile telephony and social networking applications
in all shapes and sizes. During the beginning of this new
century, society at large is starting to embrace these new
tools, changing forever the way we communicate, coordinate
our activities and organize social interactions (Bell, 1973;
Castells, 1996; Freeman & Louça, 2001; Negroponte, 1995;
Perez, 1983; Webster, 1995). At the core is the question of
access to digital networks, and, in particular, who gets
empowered and who is informationally marginalized by use
of these new tools.
As a contribution to this ongoing discussion, this article
analyzes the differences between men's and women's access
to and use of Information and Communication Technology
(ICT) in developing countries. We start with a literature
review that shows that some see digital technologies as
practical and tangible tools for women to overcome longstanding
inequalities. ICT can help women to gain employment
(for example through telework or newly created
information jobs), obtain cost-effective health services and
education (such as through online courses or software-based
literacy programs) and to increase their income (such as
through e-business channels and online transactions). In
contrast to this glass-half-full outlook stands the pervasive

and persistent counterargument that women are at a natural
disadvantage to benefit from the digital revolution because
they are less tech savvy, and more technophobic, and because
the technology is not built for their needs and intuition. If
these were the case, the increasing socio-economic importance
of ICT would add a new dimension to the already
existing vicious circle between discrimination and women's
backwardness, which can be expected to be particularly
severe in developing countries, where four out of five women
live worldwide. Unfortunately very few of the related studies
control for potentially confounding variables.1 We know that
the lack of employment, income and education affect ICT
usage negatively (e.g. Cullen, 2001; Mossberger, Tolbert, &
Stansbury, 2003; NTIA, 1999; OSILAC, 2007; Warschauer,
2003). We also know that women are discriminated against
in many aspects of social life, including employment, income
and education. Given these potential confounders, it is not
clear if being a woman per se has a negative, neutral or
positive effect on ICT usage. In the first case, the digital
revolution would pose a severe threat to women. In the latter
case, the increasing socio-economic importance of ICT would
pose a unique opportunity: the new tools would be a perfect
tool to fight existing inequalities between men and women.
To this point, lack of adequate statistical data had
prevented us from testing this question empirically. Arguments
were often based on anecdotal evidence from case
studies or uncontrolled correlations, which sometimes lead to
contradictory results. In recent years, statistical institutes and
academic research centers in the developing world have
made a significant effort to collect adequate statistical
information. For this study we employ 25 datasets from 12
Latin American and 13 African countries (total of 1,176,816
observations), which allow us to execute a series of
uncontrolled and controlled empirical tests that will provide
further insight into this unresolved question.
What is the digital divide?
The unfolding of the digital revolution is happening at
unprecedented speed (for ICT penetration rates during the
past 15 years, see ITU, 2010). However fast, it is not
immediate and the related diffusion process follows the
form of a well-known S-shaped curve, which distinguishes
between early adopters and latecomers (Rogers, 2003). While
this process unfolds, a new form of inequality is added to all
the existing forms of discrimination: an inequality in the
power to communicate and to process information digitally.
The term “digital divide” has been coined to refer to this
concept (e.g. NTIA, 1995, 1999; OECD, 2001).
Studies on the digital divide differ in their focus and
methodological approach. Despite their differences, all of
them answer (part of) the following questions: who (individuals
vs. organizations/communities, vs. societies/countries/world
regions, etc.), with which attributes (income,
education, geography, age, gender, or type of ownership, size,
profitability, sector, etc.), connect how (pain access vs. usage
vs. real impact), to what kind of technology (phone, Internet,
computer, digital TV, etc.) (see Hilbert, 2011). In this article
we test for one specific attribute of ICT users: their gender.
The main focus of this article is set on analyzing access to ICT
in Latin America and Africa, while we also sneak an exploratory
peak into how men and women use the Internet in Latin
America. This is important because literature has shown that
access and usage foster the well-being in multiple aspects of life
(e.g. Castells, 1996; Cimoli, Hofman, & Mulder, 2010; Hilbert &
Peres, 2010; Waverman, Meschi, & Fuss, 2005; Webster, 1995).
Previous research has shown that ICT adoption patterns are
characterized by the same long established determinants of
inequality as other aspects of social life, such as those related to
income, education, skills, employment, geography, age and
ethnicity, and gender, among others (e.g. Compaine, 2001;
Cullen, 2001; Hilbert, 2010; Mossberger et al., 2003; OECD,
2002; OSILAC, 2007; van Dijk, 2005; Warschauer, 2003).
What do we know about the digital gender divide?
Let us begin with clarifying that most literature in this
field refer to ICT access and usage patterns among biologically
identifiable men and women (sex), not the self-identified
gender identity of an individual, such as understood in the
field of gender studies. While it would be very interesting to
explore the relationship between the digital divide and
gender identity, the paucity of data on the last variable forces
us to follow most existing research and equate gender with
sex in this article.
During the 1990s, researchers were quick to observe that
women tend to be latecomers to the digital age (e.g. Dholakia,
Dholakia, & Pedersen, 1994; NTIA, 1999). As a consequence,
the new technology was popularly portrayed as a male
domain (Badagliacco, 1990). Bimber (2000: 2) concluded that
the gap in ICT usage between women and men “is the product
of both socioeconomic differences and some combination of
underlying, gender-specific effects”. Researchers claimed that
those gender-specific differences had their origins in the fact
that women underestimated their actual usage skills, which
lead to lower self-efficacy to use ICT (Busch, 1995; Hargittai &
Shafer, 2006; Joiner, Messer, Littleton, & Light, 1996), as well
as in their general attitudes toward computers (Shashaani,
1994). It was concluded that “men are more interested in
technology than women, and they are also more tech savvy”
(Fallows, 2005: 5). In short, women were seen as being more
likely to be technophobic and were ascribed a certain
computer anxiety. This type of reasoning is in line with a
longstanding argument that technology is gendered (Lohan &
Faulkner, 2004; Puente, 2008). ICTs are seen as yet another
“toy for the boys” (Faulkner, 2001).
As more statistics became available and Internet and
mobile telephony penetration rates began to rise, women
started to catch up in many developed countries (Rice & Katz,
2003). In the United States, most new users were women
around the year 2000 (Cummings & Krout, 2002). Gender
differences remained, but were smaller (Leggon, 2006) and
mainly concentrated on marginalized groups, such as ethnic
minorities (Tolbert, Mossberger, King, & Miller, 2007).
However, once online, women remained less frequent and
less intense users of the Internet (Ono & Zavodny, 2003;
Wasserman & Richmond-Abbott, 2005). The focus of attention
started to shift towards differences in how men and
women use ICT (Bonfadelli, 2002). For example, it was found
that girls use the Internet for instant messaging and chatrooms,
whereas boys downloaded games and music, engaged
in online trading, and created Web pages (Lenhart, Lewis, &
480 M. Hilbert / Women's Studies International Forum 34 (2011) 479–489
Rainie, 2001; Roberts, Foehr, & Foundation, 2004). Fallows
(2005: 1) summarized a survey in the United States with the
conclusion: “men like the internet for the experiences it
offers, while women like it for the human connections it
promotes”. As already mentioned, we will look at both
aspects in our subsequent analysis: access and usage, with a
focus on the first one.
Statistical data from the USC led World Internet Project
(2009)to reconfirm these findings. In Canada, 79% of men and
75% of women were online in 2007. This difference grows to 56%
to 46% for citizens of 60 years and older. The study also confirms
differences in usage. In 2004, Canadian men spent on average
more time online than women (14.3 to 12.0 h per week). This
difference increased from 2.3 to 3.5 h in 2007 (18.8 h to 15.3 h).
As the main reasons for non-usage, Australian women state lack
of interest (35%), not having a computer or Internet connection
(26%) or lack of skills (16%). The percentage of men to women
who use the Internet is reported for the following developed
countries: Australia: 74% to 71%. Czech Republic: 55% to 46%;
Hungary: 45% to 39%; Israel: 71% to 64%; New Zealand: 78% to
77%; Singapore: 69% to 54%; United Kingdom: 68% to 65%. The
two exceptions to this trend seem to be Sweden (with 75% of
men online and 78% of women) and the United States (71% to
73%). However, even in these countries, men are more frequent
and more intense users. In 2008, men from the U.S. are more
likely than women to surf the web “at least daily” (54 to 41 %)
and men spend 1.5 h more than women at their monitors
reading. In short, differences have become smaller in developed
countries, but still remain, especially in usage.
What about women and ICT in developing countries?
Due to the paucity of adequate statistics about the world's
poor, technology-related research and respective policy-advice
is often exclusively focusing on the roughly 20% of the world
population living in the most industrialized countries,2 while
the remaining 80% of the global population is frequently
ignored or inappropriately subsumed under thesefindings. This
is delicate, because living conditions, opportunities and threats
differ decisively in developed and developing countries. The
vast majority of women live in developing countries and they
often suffer even more gender related discrimination than their
counterparts in developed countries. At the same time, if ICT
were to hold a promise to empower women, then this promise
is much larger in the developing world, given that the lower
starting point provides for greater potential gains.
ICT: a threat for women
Similar to the above-cited data from developed countries
(World Internet Project, 2009), existing data from developing
countries show that women are less likely than men to use ICT.
This leads related research to the conclusion that a digital
gender divide clearly exists and is a severe threat to women: “In
many countries such gaps become dramatic, putting women at
a significant disadvantage” (Hafkin & Huyer, 2007: 33). Similar
to findings in developed countries, this divide applies to access
and to the frequency and intensity of usage (Park, 2009).
Looking for reasons, researchers normally fall back on anecdotal
case studies and local evidence, which found that women face
barriers that include lack of access and training, and that they
were confronted with software and hardware applications that
did not reflect their female interests and needs (Arun & Arun,
2002; Best & Maier, 2007; Ng & Mitter, 2005). In this sense, the
same technophobic arguments that had been raised in the
developed world during the 1990s, have been transferred to
women in the developing world in recent years. It is argued that
women have a negative attitude toward ICT (Varank, 2007) and
that the introduction of technologies has often implicitly been
designed to meet the needs of men, not of women (Basu, 2000;
Hafkin, 2000).
ICT: an opportunity for women
In contrary to these findings, some case studies and
anecdotal evidence show that ICT can and are empowering
women in developing countries. For example, ICT provide
women entrepreneurs with access to worldwide e-business
channels, which can be operated 24 h a day from home in
real-time (Brodman & Berazneva, 2007; Heeks, Arun, &
Morgan, 2004; Schaefer Davis, 2007). Ng and Mitter (2005)
look beyond ICT's contributions to economic well-being, and
show how ICTs are used by women for the purposes of
community building and political organization. ICTs enable
meaningful participation and make female voices heard, as
proven by the role of digital networks in feminist movements
(Harcourt, 1999). Others have argued that ICTs have the
potential to completely redefine traditional gender roles,
especially for women who have limited skills or who lack the
resources to invest in higher education (Kelkar & Nathan,
2002). In short, ICT can be “powerful tools for women to
overcome discrimination, achieve full equality, well-being
and participation in the decisions that determine their lives
and the future of their communities. […] ICT […] opens up a
direct window for women to the outside world. Information
flows to them without distortion or any form of censoring,
and they have access to the same information as their
counterparts” (Sharma, 2003: 1). However, this potential to
empower women in the developing world depends on access
to and actual usage of these technologies, which is a necessary
first step (see e.g. Scott, 2001).
How can misleading statistics mask the reality about the gender
divide?
We have seen that the literature is inconclusive. We do not
know if ICTs are a severe threat or an opportunity for women.
What could be the reason for this apparent contradiction?
There is a subtle message that can often be read between
the lines of research related to the digital gender divide. For
example, Sharma (2003) points out that “women have less
online access than men, for all the usual gender-related
reasons—time, money, control, learning opportunities, other
commitments, prioritizing others' needs”. Arguing that longstanding
gender-related inequalities are the reason for less
usage is very different from arguing that women are naturally
technophobic. It has widely been measured that women
around the world are discriminated in fields like employment,
income and education (see e.g. Anand & Sen, 1995). It is
therefore not clear if these existing inequalities lead to the
fact that women make less usage of ICT or, if being a woman
per se has a negative effect on ICT usage. This problem is well
known in statistics and is treated under the topic of so-called
M. Hilbert / Women's Studies International Forum 34 (2011) 479–489 481
“confounding variables” (e.g. Freedman, Purves, & Pisani,
2007).
Often the confounder is easy to spot. For example, if
somebody would realize that children's ICT usage is positively
correlated to the size of their shoes, most people would become
suspicious and reason that age, and therefore literacy skills,
might confound this relation. There is no reason to believe that
the shoe size of children with the same level of schooling would
make any significant difference. Often it is not as easy. But the
cure remains the same: as soon as there is a suspicion of
confounding variables, it is wise to control for them and to
compare subjects on the same level of such variables. If the
result still makes a difference, it is more probable that the
original variable has explanatory power. If not, the confounder
made the difference.3
What does the data say?
The most frequently analyzed statistics so far have been
collected by telecommunication administrative authorities
and have been harmonized by the United Nations Telecommunications
Union (e.g. ITU, 2010). Traditionally, these
administrative registers collect the national aggregates of
the numbers of subscriptions, connections and devices and
therefore do not allow detailed cross-tabulations with user
attributes (like gender, income, employment, education, etc.).
Those are provided by the household surveys that we will use.
Our databases are both products of the initial seed funding
of Canada's International Development Research Centre
(IDRC). In Latin America, IDRC has cooperated since 2002
with the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin
America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) to operate OSILAC
(Observatory for the Information Society in Latin America
and the Caribbean).4 During the last decade, OSILAC has
successfully worked with National Statistics Offices all over
the region to include ICT indicators in existing household
surveys. Given the large samples of official household
surveys, this data is very robust (all used sample sizes are
between 21,000 and 408,000).5 Parts of these databases are
publicly available (OSILAC, 2009). In Africa, IDRC is cooperating
with the Research ICT Africa Network,6 which has
conducted their own household and individual user surveys
of ICT access and usage between 2007 and 2008 (sample sizes
between 819 and 2355).7 Despite the smaller sample size,
this is nonetheless an important effort, as Africa is normally
considered a black hole for technology related statistics (for
overview of these surveys see Gillwald & Stork, 2008).
Controlling correlations in Latin America
Let us start with a series of simple correlations between
gender and both, Internet usage and mobile phone usage. It is
important to underline that we use the question of active usage
by a specific person as an indicator for access, not the plain
existence of equipment in a household. We use the Pearson
correlation coefficient to measure the degree of association
between two correlation coefficients (e.g. Freedman et al.,
2007; Williams & Monge, 2001), in our case between being a
woman and using the Internet.We code in a way that a negative
correlations (rb0) means that women use less Internet than
men, while rb0 implies that Internet usage is positively
correlated with being a woman.8
A first look at the upper two rows of Table 1 reveals that
most of the correlations between ICT usage and being a
woman turn out to be negative. In agreement with previous
findings, the overall data show that women are less likely
than men to use the Internet or a mobile phone. In Brazil, for
example, the region's largest country with over a third of the
region's GDP and population, being a women is negatively
correlated with using the Internet (with a correlation
coefficient of r=−0.022), and with using a mobile phone
(with r=−0.029).9
In the following rows of Table 1 show two kinds of the
inequalities between men and women in percentage points. It
is shown that there are real inequalities between men and
women regarding their working status (being employed or selfemployed)
and their current attendance at an educational
institution. Continuing with the example of Brazil, 92.2% of all
men are actively working, compared to only 83.7% of women,
and 31.6% of all men currently attend an educational establishments,
compared to 30.8% of all women. These differences do
not seem to be very large, but let us see what happens when we
control for them. This can be done with a partial correlation,
which measures the degree of association between two
variables when the effects of a third variable are removed
(see e.g. Williams & Monge, 2001). To be more precise: what is
the relationship between being a women and ICT usage when
the effect of work or current schooling is removed?
Table 1 shows that in the controlled environment, being a
woman is positively correlated with using the Internet (for
Brazil r=+0.056) and with using a mobile phone (for Brazil
r=+0.033). While this correlation is still very low, it is striking
that this turn-around effect is consistent throughout almost all
analyzed countries, which represent a very heterogeneous
group of socio-demographic and cultural societies. There are
some countries in which women are more active Internet users
to begin with (Panama, Honduras, Nicaragua) or more active
mobile phone users (Dominican Republic, Panama, Nicaragua),
which of course naturally argues in favor of women being more
active ICT users to begin with. There are also cases in which
women are not discriminated in the fields of employment status
(Nicaragua) or current attendance at an educational establishment
(Panama and Ecuador). This does not affect thelogic of our
result. The overwhelming majority of the cases show that, when
controlling for working and educational enrollment conditions,
women make more use of digital ICT than men. The only
exception in the 20 changes in tendency that can be observed in
Table 1 is mobile phone usage in Ecuador: the correlation
coefficient becomes weaker in the controlled test, but continues
to stay negative (r=−0.037). This reminds us of the fact that
social science is not an exact science.
Let us dig deeper into this question and open up this
statistical black box to see what actually accounts for these
results. The first two rows of Table 2 show the actual
percentages that lead to the previous finding that in most
countries more men than women use the Internet. Continuing
with our example of Brazil, 22.0% of men use the Internet
compared to 20.2% of women. In mobile phone usage the divide
is at 38.5% to 35.4%. In agreement with the results from Table 1,
the notable exceptions for Internet usage are Panama,
Honduras and Nicaragua, and for cell phone users, Dominican
482 M. Hilbert / Women's Studies International Forum 34 (2011) 479–489
Republic, Panama and Nicaragua. The following rows show
what happens if we put men and women on “equal footing”
regarding their working condition. We only consider men and
women who are either employed or self-employed, neglecting
those who are unemployed, retired or stay at home without
salary. Based on this condition, it turns out that in all countries
more women than men use ICT actively, again with the sole
exception of mobile phone usage in Ecuador. In Brazil, only
22.8% of all working men use the Internet, while 28.5% of all
working women are online. Only 47.0% of all Brazilian working
men use a mobile phone, while 50.6% of all working women
telecommunicate on the go. The same general change in
direction accounts for ICT when controlled for current
attendance at an educational establishment. Once in school,
women turn out to be more active users of digital opportunities
(35.6% to 36.2% for Internet use in Brazil; 32.5% to 39.9% for
mobile usage). The exceptions to the general rule for Internet
usage are again Ecuador, as well as Costa Rica and Dominican
Republic. Generally speaking, the differences are much more
pronounced for mobile phone usage than for Internet use. Once
set on equal footing in terms of employment and education,
women seem to embrace mobile voice communication quite a
bit more enthusiastically than men.
These results seem to indicate that women are the more
enthusiastic ICT users. However, one could argue that this
tendency originates in the fact that women are more likely to
be forced to use computers at work for unsophisticated and
repetitive secretarial tasks (e.g. Kaplan, 1994). In this case,
force, not enthusiasm would be the reason for our results.
Saying it very bluntly, the argument would be that men at
construction sites do not need Internet access, while female
secretaries are forced by their employers to execute trivial
typing jobs and routine office activities, such as banal word
processing and spreadsheet work. This general tendency could
also affect ICT-enthusiasm in school, since girls and boys often
already anticipate their future job. While this sounds like a
possible hypothesis, this argument cannot explain the detected
differences in mobile phone usage. Besides, as shown by the
lower rows in Table 2, working women do not only access the
Internet when forced to do so by their employers in their
working environment, but women are also more active online
users at home, at public access centers or commercial cyber
cafes, and even at other people's homes. Continuing with our
example of Brazil, Table 2 confirms that more working women
use the Internet at their job than men (14.8% to 17.8%), but at
the same time more women also go online at home (11.7% to
14.2%) at a communal access center (1.6% to 2.3%), a
commercial public access center (4.2% to 4.3%) or at the
home of family and friends (6.2% to 7.4%). While ICT access at
work might still have a catalyzing role, it can be seen that
working women also make use of their digital skill outside the
working environment. Rather than being forced to ICT usage
against their will by an external force, it seems that women
naturally enjoy the use of digital communication wherever
they get the opportunity to do so.
Women and ICT in Africa

rates in Africa (see Table 3). Sample sizes are much smaller in

it more difficult to detect differences. While all results of the
weighted samples turn out to be significant (weighted
stratified samples with pb0.01), they are less robust than
the ones from Latin America. Having said this, the general
tendencies are the same. In agreement with the traditional
findings of literature, the overall correlation between gender
and ICT usage shows that in 11 of the 13 countries, a larger
percentage of men use the Internet than women (with the
exception of Rwanda and Tanzania, in which women already
represent the larger share). In Kenya, for example, one of the
larger and technologically most advanced African countries of
our sample, 21.1% of all men have been online in 2007/8,
while only 11.5% of all women use the Internet. 56.0% of all
men use a mobile phone, vs. only 46.9% of all women.
Notwithstanding, the following rows of Table 3 show that,
in general, African women are also less literate10 (in Kenya
77.2% of men to 68.0% of women), and that fewer women are
actively working or studying (employed, self-employed or
full-time student) (81.4% of Kenyan men to 49.9% of women).
Women also have less income (29.8% of all Kenyan men
belong to the top 25% income group of the country, while only
16.6% of all women do).
On the basis of these characteristics, a new group was
created. We will refer to it as “women on equal footing”,
simply for the sake of giving it a name. In this group we only
consider men and women who are literate, are actively
working or studying and who belong to the top 25% income
group.11 Controlling for these three inequalities, we can see
that the gender divide disappears in most African countries
for women “on equal footing”. In the case of Kenya, the divide
in Internet usage is erased at 29.7% for both men and women,
while women on equal footing turn out to be more active
mobile phone users (90.0% to 92.7%). When placed on equal
footing, the ratio of women vs. men turns around for Internet
usage in four of the 13 analyzed countries (Namibia, Ethiopia,
Mozambique, Senegal). For another six countries, men
continue to use the Internet more, but the relative difference
diminishes in all cases (South Africa, Benin, Botswana, Ghana,
Uganda, Cote d'Ivoire). For example, in South Africa, in the
uncontrolled environment, the share of men online is almost
twice as large (20.2% of men to 11.3% of women), while it
shrinks to a difference of merely 5% for men and women on
equal footing (39.9/37.7= 1.05).
This observed change in tendency is again much more
pronounced for mobile phone usage. In nine of the 13 countries,
these controls turn the inequality around.With the exception of
Senegal and Tanzania, women on equal footing tend to embrace
mobile telephony more than men.
How do men and women use the Internet
As seen during the literature review, studies from developed
countries reported that men and women use the Internet for
different ends, which can lead to diverse definition of the digital
divide. Let us now take a look at the kind of online services used
in Latin America. This is of particular interest because we have
already seen that women welcome the use of digital tools;
therefore, the kinds of services they use might give us hints
about possible digital opportunities for women (Table 4). The
first row confirms the previously mentioned finding from

users than women. This accounts for Chile, Uruguay, Costa Rica,
Dominican Republic and Nicaragua, while in Mexico and
Honduras more women tend to be online every day. When
evaluating these statistics, we have to remember that usage
frequency does not tell us anything about the length of each
session. Longer sessions could by far offset lower frequency.
Unfortunately the available statistics do not give us insight into
the overall intensity of usage.
When asked about the kinds of services used online, men
reveal that they are much more enthusiastic about using the
Internet for entertainment reasons than women. When it
comes to using digital channels for education and training,
the data is clear that women tend to make much better use of
the existing opportunities than men. This is especially
encouraging when considering the previously presented
results of female disadvantages in terms of literacy and
educational attendance throughout the developing world
(see Tables 1 and 3). It shows that women already started to
make use of the digital opportunities to fight those existing
inequalities.
Table 4 also shows that women still do not yet fully exploit
many of the other opportunities the digital world provides for
them. Women are less enthusiastic about applications of ebusiness
and e-government. The use of e-business and online
banking channels could provide women with important steps
to improve their financial independence, while e-government
services facilitate necessary, but often burdensome interactions
with public authorities. The use of the Internet for plain
communication purposes provides a mixed picture, as do the
statistics on health services. Women from Mexico and
Dominican Republic are already using online networks to
improve the health conditions for themselves and those close
to them. Overall, there still seems to be a large potential to
take advantage (or maybe create) adequate online content to
improve living conditions for women in Latin America.
A word of caution on the presented statistics
The humorist Mark Twain (1835–1910) has popularized
the wisdom that “there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned
lies, and statistics”. This does not only apply to the statistical
practices of not controlling for confounding variables, such as
criticized in this article, but a word of caution is also in order
when interpreting the statistics in the presented tables.
Given the large sample sizes of the weighted household
samples, all results turn out to be statistically significant.
However, all results are based on stratified samples, meaning
that the survey organizers took the sample according to their
knowledge about how the population is distributed in a
particular country. Once collected, stratified samples are
weighted according to the proportions of the actual society.
The answers of one survey correspondent from a more
common socio-demographic group might be multiplied with
a factor much larger than a person from a minority. This
weighting turns a small sample into the representative of a
large population. Nevertheless, it also affects significance
tests. The theory of significance test is based on random
sampling, not on stratified samples that are subsequently
expanded. If the weighted number of cases exceeds the
sample size, tests of significance tend to be inflated, which is
our case. Therefore, even though all our results are statistically
significant, meaning that it is very probable that the
observed differences between men and women are real and
not just due to chance, these tests are inflated.
As a consequence, results that are very close (such as
49.5% to 50.5% or a correlation of 0.008), have to be taken
with a large grain of salt, as pure luck of sample drawing
might play us a trick here. Given the much smaller sample
size in Africa than in Latin America, the Latin American results
are more reliable and stable than the African surveys (in the
Latin American samples each observation was weighted with
hundreds of people on average, while in Africa, factors of
thousands were applied). Having said this, differences for one
country on the decimal level surely would not make a strong
case by itself. However, the consistency of our results across a
large number of very heterogeneous societies makes a
relatively strong case: even though some results are close
and might be influenced by chance, they tend to show the
same direction in general. In other words, the presented
results should be interpreted as a mutually confirming whole,
while specific results for particular countries might be subject
to small variations. Particularly close results from one specific

country should not be used as a standalone argument and
might require more detailed sampling and further analysis.
A small change in mindset can sometimes make a large
difference
We have analyzed a very heterogeneous group of 25
countries, representing different levels of development, geography,
culture and social structure. According to the United
Nations Human Development Index (UNDP, 2008), Chile is the
most developed country of our sample, reaching a rank 40 of
the 179 countries included in the 2008 Index. Mozambique is
the least developed with a rank of 175. Independent from these
differences, our results have been surprisingly consistent: ICT
per se does not have anything on them that might keep women
and girls from using it in developing countries. In fact, when
controlled for existing inequalities, it shows that women
embrace digital technology more enthusiastically than men.
One might be tempted to speculate that women are simply
better communicators and that therefore the use of these
technologies seems more intuitive for women than for men.
Unfortunately, the presented data do not tell us why women
use ICT more than men; they just tell us that this is the case.
Notwithstanding, women continue to be discriminated in
many other aspects of social life, including employment,
literacy and income. These inequalities also throw their
shadows on ICT usage. More specifically, being a woman is
positively correlated with ICT usage, and negatively correlated
with employment, income and education (see Tables 2 and
3). Uncontrolled correlations mix both effects, resulting in the
fact that underemployed, underpaid and undereducated
women use ICT less than men. Traditional discrimination in
the fields of employment, income and education turn the
positive correlation between women and ICT into a negative
one. At the same time, as shown during the literature review,
ICTs have the potential to provide access to employment,
education and income. Therefore, ICTs provide women with a
bootstrapping opportunity to pull themselves out of these
unfavorable starting conditions. In other words, if woman are
provided with ICT, digital tools represent an opportunity for
women to fight longstanding inequalities.
The resulting logic is schematized in Fig. 1. Traditionally,
longstanding inequalities prevent women from accessing ICT,
leading to a vicious circle between digital exclusion, unemployment,
low income and lacking education. However, once
having access to ICT, this vicious circle can be turned into a
virtuous circle, whereas the identified positive attitudes of
women toward ICT enable them to circumvent and fight
existing inequalities.
This finding is by no means the end, but leads to the
question of how to provide more women with access to digital
opportunities. For example, Table 2 indicates that communal or
commercial public access centers might be a viable option (see
also Maeso & Hilbert, 2006). Others have pointed to the need of
regulations and incentives to facilitate the actual usage of
applications that would favor women, such as legislation to
promote telework (see e.g. Boiarov, 2008). Besides, the
development of adequate content becomes a major concern,
especially in key areas such as education (see e.g. RELPE, 2008).
Summing up, the empirical evidence in this article argues
for a re-thinking about women and ICT usage. This rethinking
should also affect policy making, which is unfortunately still
influenced by the superficial and unsustainable argument that
women are technophobic. For example, in the final declarations
of the United Nations World Summit on the Information
Society (2003–2005), heads of States and governments have
recognized “that a gender divide exists as part of the digital
divide in society” (WSIS, 2005) and declared a need for
“enhancing communication and media literacy for women
with a view to building the capacity of girls and women to
understand and to develop ICT content” (WSIS, 2003). These
statements seem to be based on the idea that women are less
digitally capable. Based on the results here presented, this is
not at all the case and a change in mindset seems appropriate.
These policy statements should rather be reformulated to
something along the following lines: “a digital gender divide
exists only as a direct reflection of existing gender-related
inequalities and policy actions should make use of the natural
communication skills and media capacities of women and their
proven embrace of the new digital opportunities to overcome
longstanding gender inequalities”. Such re-thinking is necessary
to create policies and projects that truly allow girls and
women to become equal members of an information society,
digital society, network society, knowledge society, or simply
equal members of society, independent from the forename it
may be given.
End Notes
1 A notable exception for the case of the United States is Rice and Katz
(2003), which, after control, do not detect any significant digital divide
between men and women. The author is not aware of any controlled studies
for the digital gender divide on the international level.
2 In 2006, the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), which represents the world's “industrialized
countries”, was home to 1184 million inhabitants, within a world
population of 6555 million (18%).
3 This does not change the fact that children with larger shoes will have better
ICT usage scores. Same accounts for the case of ICT and women: might be that
women use ICT less than men, but the question is why: because they are
women, or because of some other reasons that come with being a woman?

8 Pearson's r is normalized between +1 and −1, where +1 is a perfect
positive association and −1 is a perfect negative association. A correlation
near zero indicates that there is no relationship between the two variables.
9 A second look at the data reveals that the identified correlations are not very
strong (even though they are all statistically significant, weighted and stratified
samples with pb0.001). Squaring Pearson's correlation coefficient tells us how
much of the variation in ICT usage can be explained by variation in being male or
female. In all cases, less than 0.5% of the variation in ICT usage can be explained
by gender (for example, in Chile r2=−0.0472=0.2%). There must be much
more powerful explanatory variables that determine ICT usage than gender.
10 Literacy was defined by including all respondents that claimed to be able
to read the newspaper easily and to write a letter easily.
11 In the case of Africa it is necessary to focus on this high-income group of
the top-25%, since income levels in general are relatively low (in absolute
terms) and ICTs are tradable goods with price levels that are only accessible
to segments that reach a certain absolute level of income (see Hilbert,
2010).
